This project focuses on using a game controller (in this case an xbox controller) as an interface for an arduino.
I made this in order to integrate it into a larger project of which I am currently building. The benefits of this 
project are as follows:
 - Normal rc controllers are not as customizable, and if they are, they are also expensive.
 - Building a controller from scratch with multiple arduinos will actually take longer and be harder to setup for me.
