Make sure to drag and drop the ELECHOUSE_C1101 library folder into your Arduino libraries folder!!!



Quick message: I originally made this for a remote ignition method for 
               model rockets and prototype mixes. However, this setup 
               has plenty of application for other projects that could 
               use a simple way to communicate between devices.
